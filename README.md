# Explaining Latents in Turing-LLM-1.0-254M with Pre-Defined Function Types

Interpreting the latent representations within large language models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge in advancing AI transparency and control. This study introduces a novel framework for explaining latents in the Turing-LLM-1.0-254M model based on a predefined set of function types, allowing for a more human-readable “source code” of the model’s internal mechanisms. By categorising latents using multiple function types, we move towards mechanistic interpretability that does not rely on potentially unreliable explanations generated by other language models. Evaluation strategies include generating unseen sequences using Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct provided by GoodFire AI to test the activation patterns of latents, thereby validating the accuracy and reliability of the explanations.
